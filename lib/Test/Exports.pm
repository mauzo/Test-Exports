=head1 NAME

Test::Exports - Test that modules export the right symbols

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;
    use Test::Exports;
    
    require_ok "My::Module" or BAIL_OUT "can't load module";

    import_ok "My::Module", [],             "default import OK";
    is_import qw/foo bar/, "My::Module",    "imports subs";

    new_import_pkg;

    import_ok "My::Module", ["foo"],        "named import OK";
    is_import "foo", "My::Module",          "imports foo";
    cant_ok "bar",                          "doesn't import bar";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides simple test functions for testing other modules'
C<import> methods. Testing is currently limited to checking which subs
have been imported.

In order to keep different calls to C<< ->import >> separate,
Test::Exports performs these calls from a private package. The
symbol-testing functions then test whether or not symbols are present in
this private package, ensuring none of this interferes with your test
script itself.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These are all exported by default, as is usual with testing modules.

=head2 C<new_import_pkg>

Create a new package to perform imports into. This is useful when you
want to test C<< ->import >> with different arguments: otherwise you'd
need to find some way of going back and clearing up the imports from the
last call.

This returns the name of the new package (which will look like
C<Test::Exports::TestAAAAB>) in case you need it.

my $counter = "AAAAA";
my $PKG;

sub new_import_pkg { $counter++; $PKG = "$CLASS\::Test$counter" }
new_import_pkg;

=head2 C<import_ok $module, \@args, $name>

Call C<< $module->import >> from the current testing package, passing
C<@args>, and check the call succeeded. 'Success' means not throwing an
exception: C<use> doesn't care if C<import> returns false, so neither do
we.

C<@args> defaults to the empty list; C<$name> defaults to something
sensible.

    my ($mod, $args, $msg) = @_;

    my $eval = eval $code;

    $tb->ok($eval, $msg) or $tb->diag(<<DIAG);
$mod->import(@$args) failed:
$@
DIAG
}

=head2 C<import_nok $module, \@args, $name>

Call C<< $module->import(@args) >> and expect it to throw an exception.
Defaults as for L</import_ok>.

    my $eval = eval "package $PKG; $mod->import(\@\$args); 1";

    $tb->ok(!$eval, $msg) or $tb->diag(<<DIAG);
$mod->import(@$args) succeeded where it should have failed.
DIAG
}

=head2 C<is_import @subs, $module, $name>

For each name in C<@subs>, check that the current testing package has a
sub by that name and that it is the same as the equinominal sub in the
C<$module> package.

Neither C<$module> nor C<$name> are optional.

=cut

sub is_import {
    my $msg  = pop;
    my $from = pop;
    my $tb = $CLASS->builder;

    my @nok;

    for (@_) {
        my $to = "$PKG\::$_";

        no strict 'refs';
        unless (defined &$to) {
            push @nok, <<DIAG;
  \&$to is not defined
DIAG
            next;
        }

        \&$to == \&{"$from\::$_"} or push @nok, <<DIAG;
  \&$to is not imported correctly
DIAG
    }

    my $ok = $tb->ok(!@nok, $msg) or $tb->diag(<<DIAG);
Expected subs to be imported from $from:
DIAG
    $tb->diag($_) for @nok;
    return $ok;
}

=head2 C<cant_ok @subs, $name>

For each sub in @subs, check that a sub of that name does not exist in
the current testing package. If one is found the diagnostic will
indicate where it was originally defined, to help track down the stray
export.

=cut

sub cant_ok {
    my $msg = pop;
    my $tb  = $CLASS->builder;

    my @nok;

    for (@_) {
        no strict 'refs';
        exists &{$PKG . '::' . $_}
            and push @nok, $_;
    }

    my $ok = $tb->ok(!@nok, $msg);
    
    for (@nok) {
        my $from = B::svref_2object($PKG->can($_))->GV->STASH->NAME;
        $tb->diag(<<DIAG);
    \&$PKG\::$_ is imported from $from
DIAG
    }

    return $ok;
}

=head1 TODO

=head2 C<is_import>

Currently this just checks that C<\&Our::Pkg::sub == \&Your::Pkg::sub>,
which means

=over 4

=item *

it is impossible to test for exports which have been renamed, and

=item *

we can't be sure the sub originally came from Your::Pkg: it may have
been exported into both packages from somewhere else.

=back

It would be good to fix at least the former.
